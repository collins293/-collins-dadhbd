<h1>meaning of coding </h1>
<p>Coding, also known as  <em>programming,</em> is the process of <strong>designing and building executable computer programs</strong>. it involves writing instructions in a programming language to instruct  a computer to perform specific task.<br />
    The names of pioneers to coding are <cite>Ada lovelace</cite> <cite>charles barbbage</cite> and <cite>Alan turing</cite><br />

<h3>basics of coding</h3>
<p> These are <dl>

 <dt>1 Logic and Algorithm </dt> <dd>Coding involves creating step-by-step instructions (algorithms) to solve problems and achieve desired outcomes.</dd>

<dt>2 Syntax</dt> Understanding and using the correct <mark>>programming</mark> language syntax is crucial for writing error-free code.</dd>

<dt>3 Variable</dt> Variables store and manage data in a program, acting as containers for information.</dd>

<dt>4 Data Types </dt> Different types of data, such as integers, strings, and booleans, are used in coding to represent various kinds of information.</dd>

<dt>5 Control Flow</dt>Conditional statements (if, else) and loops (for, while) control the flow of execution in a program.</dd>

<dt>6 Functions</dt> Breaking down code into reusable functions promotes modularity and readability, making programs more manageable.</dd>
<dt>7 Comments</dt> Documenting code with comments helps explain its purpose and functionality to others (or yourself) who may read the code later.</dd>

<dt>8 Debugging</dt> Identifying and fixing errors in code is an essential skill. Debugging tools and a systematic approach help locate and resolve issues.</dd>

<dt>9 Version Control</dt> Using version control systems like Git helps manage and track changes in code, facilitating collaboration and project management.</dd>

<dt>10 Problem Solving </dt>Coding involves breaking down problems into smaller, solvable tasks and applying a systematic approach to find solutions.</dd>

To code in HTML, you can follow these basic steps:

    1. *Set Up Your Environment:*
       - Use a text editor like Notepad, Visual Studio Code, or Sublime Text.
       <li> Create a new file with a .html extension.</li>
    
       <li>  Structure Your HTML:*
       - Start with the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration to specify the HTML version.
       - Use the <html> element as the root of your document.
       - Include the <head> section for meta-information and the <body> section for content.</li>
    

        <li>  Add Metadata:
       - Inside the <head>, use the <meta> tag for character set, viewport settings, and other metadata.</li>
    
        <li> Title Your Page:
       - In the <head>, add a <title> tag to define the title of your HTML document.</li>
    
        <li>  Include CSS:
       - Link external CSS files using the <link> tag within the <head> or use the <style> tag for internal CSS.</li>
    
    <span>Remember to continuously practice and refer to html documentation for more advanced features and best practices.</span
